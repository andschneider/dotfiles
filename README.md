# dotfiles

My configuration I use on Mac and Ubuntu.

I use my Ansible [setup repo](https://github.com/andschneider/dotfile-setup) to
install/manage everything on various platforms. While it might be overkill for
basically creating some symlinks, I really like the Ansible approach. Something
about configuring a fresh VM or remote host, from the comfort of my own shell,
before I even start using it is pretty cool.
