# dotfiles

My configuration I use on Mac and Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04.

I use my Ansible based [setup repo](https://github.com/andschneider/workstation) to install/manage everything on various platforms. While it might be overkill for basically creating some symlinks, I really like the Ansible approach. Something about configuring a fresh VM or remote host, from the comfort of my own shell, before I even start using it is pretty cool.
